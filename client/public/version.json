    "✅ Fixed checkbox column width - constrained to w-10 (40px)",
    "Problem: Checkbox column was expanding because data columns had explicit widths but checkbox didn't",
    "Solution: Added w-10 class to both checkbox th (header) and td (body)",
    "Now matches Interview System Contacts page table layout EXACTLY",
    "Accessible at: /actions-new for testing",
    "Users must HARD REFRESH (Cmd+Shift+R) to see the fix!"
